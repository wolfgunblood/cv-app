## Motivation
My motivation in building this project was to further solidify my understanding of how React handles state. For me at the time, a CV application that needs to handle all user data in state seemed like a reasonable approach to it. Furthermore, I created CVs for all my friends for some years now and felt like some automation to speed up that process wouldn't do no harm.
